#AIM OF THE PROGRAM IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE LOOPS WORK
#WRITE A SHORT PROGRAM THAT PRINTS THE NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 10 USING A FOR LOOP THEN WRITE THE EQUIVALENT PROGRAM THAT PRINTS THE NUMBERS USING A 
#WHILE LOOP

for number in range(1,11): #The first argument is where the number will start(1) and second argument is where it will end(11){which is till 10}
    print(number)
    
#Now printing using the while loop
i = 1 
while i<11:
    print(i)
    i = i+1
